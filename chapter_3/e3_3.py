# 3-3. Your Own List: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

cars = ['volvo','bmw','ferrari','mercedes']

print(f"I used to have a {cars[0].title()}.")
print(f"Once I drove a convertible {cars[1].upper()}!")
print(f"One day I would like to drive a {cars[2].title()}")
print(f"I like {cars[-1].title()}, maybe I will own one someday!")
