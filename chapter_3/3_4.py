# 3-4. Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

invitees = ['Obama','Senna','Einstein']
print(f'You\'re invited to my dinner, {invitees[0].title()}!')
print(f'You\'re invited to my dinner, {invitees[1].title()}!')
print(f'You\'re invited to my dinner, {invitees[-1].title()}!')
